One evening my friends and I were sitting in a discord.
Scrolling through the pages of the steam store, I came across the train simulator game.
This game had a lot of add-ons, the price of which was not given out in the search.
I had the idea to download the data from the search page to notepad and write a program for analyzing this data.
That's it
